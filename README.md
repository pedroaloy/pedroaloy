### Itinerary-Stations (Go language, Algorithm Design) by Henrik Kuusipalo & Pedro Aloy
#### Sep 2024 - Oct 2024
Script developed with Go language that takes in specifically formatted text maps of station names and their intertwined connections. 

Then it uses the connection to find the shortest amount of time (in turns) it takes for any number of trains to reach a common goal from a named station.

In case of errors, the script outputs what caused it, so you may look into it and try again. To help with testing particular error cases, a map pool with different names are found in a separate error maps/ folder.
